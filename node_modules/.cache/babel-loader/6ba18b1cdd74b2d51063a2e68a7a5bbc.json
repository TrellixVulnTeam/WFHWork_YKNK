(\r\n            <>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Painting the interior of your home for a fresh new look can seem\r\n                simple. After all, it’s about adding the right color paint to a\r\n                flat surface, right?\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                However, doing the ideal paint job requires skill to achieve\r\n                that professional and even look.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                These 9 tips will help you make the most of your interior house\r\n                painting. Let’s find out!\r\n              </p>\r\n              <span>1. Start by cleaning the surface</span>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Before you can even think about applying paint to any home\r\n                interior, the first thing that you should do is to clean the\r\n                wall surfaces. This helps remove any dirt or foreign matter from\r\n                the wall.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                A tack cloth is inexpensive and simple to use and is a perfect\r\n                tool for cleaning the wall surfaces. It can easily pull off\r\n                dirt, and when dealing with a wooden wall, it can remove any\r\n                sawdust and bits of loose paint.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Another major benefit of using a tack cloth is eliminating the\r\n                need to use a wet cloth on the walls.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                But don’t worry if you don’t have a tack cloth as you can always\r\n                use a damp cloth instead to clean the surface of the wall.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                That said, it is important to note that you should not use a\r\n                tach cloth for large wall surfaces. Instead, you will get the\r\n                best results when using it for small wall surfaces.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Since a tack cloth uses beeswax, never apply too much pressure\r\n                when cleaning the wall as it will only cause beeswax stains on\r\n                the walls.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <span>2. Get high-quality paintbrush and roller</span>\r\n              <p>\r\n                The keyword here is high quality. If you go for cheap and poor\r\n                quality rollers for instance, they will leave lint and bumps as\r\n                you paint the walls. When the paint eventually dries, these\r\n                bumps will be easily noticeable and will be extremely hard to\r\n                fix.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Similarly, poor quality brushes will leave streak marks and will\r\n                also leave strips of hair onto the paint. This will result in a\r\n                low-quality paint job.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Many homeowners looking to paint their home interior are often\r\n                tempted to use chip brushes. However, these are not meant for\r\n                interior home painting. They are designed for the application of\r\n                glue, solvents, and adhesives.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Getting quality rollers and paintbrushes means that you can\r\n                achieve a smooth, glossy, and professional finish to your paint\r\n                job.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <span>3. Top-quality paint</span>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Having good quality tools will mean little if you don’t combine\r\n                these with good quality paint.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                You want to steer clear of cheap builders paint. These have few\r\n                solids compared to the higher quality paints.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                You thus need to go for a paint with higher quantity solids.\r\n                These will produce the best finish and will last for a long time\r\n                in the future.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <span>4. Test for any loose paint</span>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Chances are when repainting your home interior that you plan on\r\n                adding a new coat of paint to an existing coat of paint.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                The last you need is to apply paint where the underlying coat is\r\n                loose and is coming off. The best way to test whether the\r\n                initial paint is coming off is to use the duct tape test.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Add duct tape to the wall, hold one end of the tape and then rip\r\n                it out. If you notice paint coming off, then it's best to\r\n                consider removing the paint and sanding the wall before adding\r\n                the fresh new paint.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Otherwise, if you put on fresh paint on loose paint, then odds\r\n                are you will start to see the paint coming off the wall after a\r\n                few months.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                If you are not confident in your skills as a painter, consider\r\n                getting the services of a professional through{\" \"}\r\n                <Link to=\"https://tapatradie.com/\">Tap a Tradie</Link>.

Have your latex or Nitrile gloves on</span>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Water-based paints are simple to remove and will often come out\r\n                after a thorough wash. However, enamel or oil based paints can\r\n                be difficult to clean off your hands.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Put on latex gloves to ensure that your hands remain clean when\r\n                painting your home interior. Some people, however, are allergic\r\n                to latex.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>If you are one of them, consider nitrile gloves.</p>\r\n              <span>6. Use a low stick painters tape</span>\r\n              <p>\r\n                There will be surfaces on your interior walls that will not be\r\n                painted. To prevent such surfaces from getting paint, use a low\r\n                stick painter's tape.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                The main benefit of this tape is that the adhesive is not as\r\n                strong as that of duct tape and is therefore simple for people\r\n                without removing the wall paint.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <span>7. Avoiding overlap marks</span>\r\n              <p>\r\n                When painting, you will need a strategy to help you avoid\r\n                overlap marks. These marks are more likely to show the glossier\r\n                the paint.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                If you are looking for a defined separation, using a wet edge\r\n                can help you achieve that.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                You will not need to worry about overlap marks with matte or\r\n                flat paint, and you thus don’t need a wet edge.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <span>8. Using a masking film</span>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Professional painters will often use masking film to cover any\r\n                areas where they don’t want the paint to get to.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                It is a useful tool to have as it sticks easily onto surfaces.\r\n                This is unlike the thicker plastic sheeting often used to cover\r\n                furniture when painting.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                With the masking film, all you need to do is place it on top of\r\n                a surface, and it will stick without the need for adhesive. It\r\n                does this through the use of static electricity.{\" \"}\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                This is highly convenient when working on large walls to help\r\n                save time.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <span>9. Wrapping brushes and rollers</span>\r\n              <p>\r\n                After working on your home painting project, then comes the task\r\n                that many people do not enjoy. That is cleaning the rollers and\r\n                paintbrushes.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Often even after thoroughly cleaning the rollers, some paint may\r\n                remain, which causes the roller to become stiff after drying.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                However, if you intend to use the roller soon, then you don’t\r\n                have to deal with the task of cleaning it every evening. Simply\r\n                put the roller with paint in a plastic bag and put them in the\r\n                freezer.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                You could also just wrap the roller in the bag and place it\r\n                somewhere at room temperature.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                As for the brush, you can store it the same way as the roller or\r\n                use a paint comb.{\" \"}\r\n              </p>\r\n            </>\r\n          ) : null}\r\n          {blogsArticleId === \"plumbing.jpg\" ?

A proper plumber should have\r\n                these in place and are strong evidence that the plumber takes\r\n                his or her work seriously.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Also, check their work comp policy. This should be up to date.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                And while you may have home owner’s protection policy, the last\r\n                thing you need is to be solely responsible for the damage caused\r\n                by the plumber.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <span>2. Soft skills</span>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Look for signs such as etiquette and good manners. Do they park\r\n                the car at the right place, do they talk respectfully on the\r\n                phone and in person, and do they remove their shoes before\r\n                entering the house?\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                If the plumber displays any of these, they are likely to treat\r\n                the work with the utmost care and offer high-quality services.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <span>3. References of previous clients</span>\r\n              <p>\r\n                It is important to get a grasp of the quality of workmanship\r\n                that the plumber offers. Ask them for references of previous\r\n                clients.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Note that the plumber is more likely to offer you contacts to\r\n                their best clients. Nonetheless, it is important that you ask\r\n                the clients questions such as:\r\n              </p>\r\n              <ul>\r\n                <li>• What type of work did the plumber do for you?</li>\r\n                <li>• What did you think about the quality of work? </li>\r\n                <li>• Would you consider hiring the plumber again? </li>\r\n              </ul>\r\n              <p>\r\n                You can use the tone of voice that the client uses to judge how\r\n                satisfied they were with the plumber.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <span>4. The warranty</span>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Another way to judge the authenticity of a plumber is to ask for\r\n                a warranty. Any top-notch plumber will be familiar with the\r\n                various warranties offered by manufacturers of plumbing\r\n                products.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Furthermore, they should also offer their own workmanship\r\n                warranty. This will give you the assurance you need that you\r\n                will get a quality job.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <span>5. Community associations</span>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Many homeowners tend to overlook this step but it is a great way\r\n                to understand the nature of the business and quality of plumber\r\n                who is going to work in your house.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                If they are members of a community association such as the local\r\n                BBB and other trade associations, then there is a high chance\r\n                that the business had developed its popularity through quality\r\n                and hard work rather than through good marketing practices.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <span>Where to search for the best plumber</span>\r\n              <p>\r\n                One of the easiest and most convenient ways to search for a\r\n                plumber is online. However, you need to be careful not to pick a\r\n                plumber simply based on their search engine rankings.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Keep in mind that appearing on Google's first page may simply\r\n                mean that the plumber is a good digital marketer. This is by no\r\n                means a good reflection of their work.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Make sure that you carefully go through the business website as\r\n                one way to get a feel of the quality of the business.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                <Link to=\"https://tapatradie.com/\">Tap a Tradie</Link> lets you\r\n                quickly get access to a plumber.

That said, they are not immune to wear and\r\n                tear.\r\n              </p>\r\n\r\n              <p>\r\n                If you are hauling hard objects up concrete steps, for instance,\r\n                this can cause the steps to chip and crack. This is especially\r\n                so at the edges.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Over time the steps will appear rugged and less visually\r\n                appealing. They can drastically affect your home’s aesthetics,\r\n                making it appear neglected.\r\n              </p>\r\n\r\n              <p>\r\n                These are just some important reasons to fix and repair any\r\n                visible damage to your concrete steps.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Let’s find out how to make your concrete steps look new again.\r\n              </p>\r\n\r\n              <span>Top reasons to repair your concrete steps</span>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Besides making your home visually appealing, damaged concrete\r\n                steps can be a safety hazard to family and visitors. Keep in\r\n                mind that you are legally responsible for injuries that occur to\r\n                people when on your property.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Secondly, damage to concrete starts off slow. However, after a\r\n                certain level, the damage becomes even more significant and\r\n                happens faster.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                What may appear as a tiny and insignificant crack may quickly\r\n                become more significant and extend to the next steps? It helps\r\n                to catch the problem and repair it early to prevent further\r\n                damage and expenses.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <span>When should you repair concrete steps?</span>\r\n              <p>\r\n                You should ideally repair your concrete steps immediately you\r\n                notice any damage. This enables you to be proactive and to\r\n                prevent further damage.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Consider the temperature when doing your repair. Concrete will\r\n                cure best between 45F and 90F. Anything outside of this\r\n                temperature range will often cause the concrete to cure slowly.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <span>Starting with the basics</span>\r\n              <p>\r\n                One thing to always keep in mind before starting a concrete\r\n                repair project is that concrete dries extremely fast. It will\r\n                become hard in about 10 minutes.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                This, therefore, means that you need to work fast. As soon as\r\n                you mix the concrete, you should be ready to apply it on the\r\n                damaged area.{\" \"}\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Secondly, any dirt, debris, moss, or plant growth will prevent\r\n                the concrete from sticking.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Start by cleaning the area thoroughly and getting rid of any\r\n                dirt, debris, or foreign matter.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Next, decide the best way to repair the damaged area. If the\r\n                edges of the steps require fixing, you will need to use the\r\n                right tools like a margin trowel to sculpt the form.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                If the damage is a crack on the step, then you don’t have to\r\n                worry about sculpting the form.

Choose the ideal paint and color</span>\r\n              <p>\r\n                One of the most cost-effective ways to improve your kitchen's\r\n                look is to choose the right paint and color.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                What’s was once a dull-looking space can instantly turn into a\r\n                warm room where family and friends want to hang out.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                You can greatly improve the “wow factor” with the right color\r\n                scheme.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                A traditional white color will brighten the space and put anyone\r\n                who walks into the kitchen in the mood of fixing a delicious\r\n                meal spending and time here.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                However, if you want a more modern look and plenty of natural\r\n                light coming into the kitchen through the windows, you may\r\n                consider giving your kitchen walls a dark theme with black or\r\n                dark grey paint.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>This can help add a bit of drama and style to your kitchen.</p>\r\n              <span>2. Upgrade the kitchen cabinets</span>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Kitchen cabinets take a large surface area in the kitchen and\r\n                are among the first things that people will notice in your\r\n                kitchen.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                If they look dated and dull, they will likely make the entire\r\n                kitchen feel boring. This is why you simply cannot afford to\r\n                overlook the kitchen cabinets.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                One way to spice up your kitchen is to add a bit of contrast\r\n                with the kitchen cabinets. If you have white painted kitchen\r\n                walls, you may go with a darker gray color.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>For grey walls, consider brown kitchen cabinets.</p>\r\n              <p>Brown color is also an excellent choice for black walls.</p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Sometimes painting your kitchen cabinets is all it takes to add\r\n                drama. However, if the cabinets are worn out, don’t hesitate to\r\n                tear them down and install new cabinet doors.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <span>3. Countertops</span>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Another eye-catcher that you simply cannot afford to overlook is\r\n                kitchen countertops. Like the cabinets, you want countertops\r\n                that will blend perfectly with the rest of the kitchen.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Countertops can make or break the entire look and feel of your\r\n                kitchen.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                There are several types of countertops, including stainless\r\n                steel, laminate, and concrete.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                If you are not limited by your budget and you want to add a bit\r\n                of style and elegance, consider quartz countertops.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Quartz countertops are made from minerals and resins. And while\r\n                it appears like a natural stone, it is actually harder than\r\n                natural stone.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Other than adding style in your kitchen, quartz countertops are\r\n                impermeable. You can work comfortably on its surface without\r\n                worrying about scratching it.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Furthermore, quartz countertops come in a plethora of styles and\r\n                looks. From the concrete look to stone like appearance to\r\n                everything in between.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <span>4. Attention-grabbing backsplash</span>\r\n              <p>\r\n                When looking to grab instant attention, one of the very best\r\n                ways is to install a kitchen backsplash.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                The great thing is it is simple to install and with a little\r\n                do-it-yourself inspiration, you don’t have to hire the services\r\n                of a professional. This can help you save significantly on the\r\n                costs.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Kitchen backsplash can mean a lot of things to different\r\n                homeowners. Think of installing metal tiles, veneer stone,\r\n                laminate flooring, or tile decals.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Consider what is available on the market and its impact on the\r\n                overall look of your kitchen. Does it blend with the paint job\r\n                and the cabinet doors?\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                If so, then do not hesitate to spruce up the look of the kitchen\r\n                with some backsplash.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <span>5. Change the Lighting</span>\r\n              <p>\r\n                We often focus our attention on various other aspects of our\r\n                kitchens and completely neglect the lighting.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Bringing in stylish lighting fixtures can help add a bit of\r\n                personality to your kitchen. The best lighting fixtures are\r\n                instantly noticeable. Not only will they add to the aesthetics\r\n                but they will also offer fantastic illumination.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Pendant lighting is a trend that shows no sign of slowing down.\r\n                They can come in different designs so you can be sure to find\r\n                one that best suits your kitchen.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                When searching for the best pendant lighting fixtures, it is\r\n                best to go bold here. This ensures that anyone who walks into\r\n                your kitchen instantly notices the lights.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                That said, be careful not to overdo it. You don’t want to\r\n                install too many pendant lights or lighting that is too large.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                After all, you want the whole kitchen to blend in perfectly. You\r\n                don’t want the lights to be the center of focus in your kitchen.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <span>6. Upgrade your appliances</span>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Kitchens go hand in hand with appliances. In fact, you may argue\r\n                that appliances are at the forefront of any kitchen as they\r\n                ensure the job is done.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Question is, are your appliances helping to add to the\r\n                aesthetics of the kitchen?\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                If you have old appliances, then they may not blend well with a\r\n                more modern look. For instance, a white fridge may not work well\r\n                with black walls and brown cabinet doors.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                In this case, you will find that a silver fridge is better\r\n                suited.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                White appliances, however, can work well with white painted\r\n                walls.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Another benefit of getting modern appliances is they are more\r\n                energy-efficient. Not only do they add to the aesthetics of your\r\n                kitchen, they also help save on electricity consumption. It’s a\r\n                win win.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                When you are remodeling your kitchen, you likely want to change\r\n                the entire feel. You want your kitchen to both feel and look\r\n                brand new.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Old appliances may bring back memories of the old kitchen. New\r\n                ones, on the other hand, will make your kitchen feel completely\r\n                brand new.\r\n              </p>\r\n            </>\r\n          ) : null}\r\n          {blogsArticleId === \"electrician.jpg\" ?

What’s more, loose connections can easily start a\r\n                fire and is hazardous to family and property.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                This guide teaches you what you need to know about the\r\n                electrical connection. With the information, you can make sure\r\n                that any connection in your home is done the right way. You can\r\n                eliminate the risk of fire or damage and ensure that your\r\n                household uses electricity safely.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                One of the main areas that you will need to focus on are the\r\n                electrical wires and the circuit breakers. Both the wires and\r\n                the circuit breakers need to be of the right size.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>Without further ado, let’s dive straight in!</p>\r\n              <span>Connecting appliances</span>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Whether it’s a coffee maker an induction cooker or a fridge,\r\n                each appliance that you have on your home will be connected to\r\n                an electric outlet. On top of that, each type of appliance will\r\n                have a circuit breaker outlet.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                The great thing is that with a little know-how, it is not hard\r\n                to connect your electrical appliances to an outlet.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>You will need to make sure that you have the right tools. </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                One of the main factors that you need to consider is installing\r\n                a circuit breaker for your electrical appliances. Once there is\r\n                a power overload, the unit can disconnect the circuit, thus\r\n                prevent damage to your appliances.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Think of a circuit as a fuse, only this time, unlike the fuse,\r\n                which gets damaged during a power surge, the circuit breaker\r\n                simply cuts off the current and can be reused time and again.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                If you have an electric range, this is how you can connect a\r\n                power chord.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <ul>\r\n                <li>\r\n                  Start by removing the cover plate of the wire connection.\r\n                </li>\r\n                <li>\r\n                  If necessary, alter the ground connection. This will depend on\r\n                  the color of the wires in the terminal block and the type of\r\n                  cord you were intending to use.\r\n                </li>\r\n                <li>\r\n                  Connect the 4 prong chord or the 3 prong cord depending on the\r\n                  type of electric range\r\n                </li>\r\n                <li>\r\n                  Install the strain relief clamp. This will help grip the cord\r\n                  and protect the connection.\r\n                </li>\r\n                <li>Fix back the cover plate and you are good to go.</li>\r\n              </ul>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Don’t worry of you don’t have any electrical experience or\r\n                simply prefer to not handle electrical components.

For instance, if a heater is plugged in in a wire\r\n                that isn’t built for the current amount, this could cause the\r\n                wire to heat and, in turn, meet the surrounding plastic cover.\r\n                This can ignite and cause a fire.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                If you were to load appliances on a wire gauge designed to carry\r\n                more current than the appliance needs, you don’t have to worry\r\n                about overheating and resulting fires. These are just two of the\r\n                important reasons why it’s important to choose the ideal wire\r\n                size.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                The color will help you identify whether the wire is neutral,\r\n                hot or is a ground wire.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Keep in mind that you need to pay special attention to the type\r\n                of wire.
