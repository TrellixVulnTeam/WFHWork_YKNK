(Note that while the Pro Products\r\n        described below are available to all Service Providers, if you\r\n        participate in our Tap A Tradie Services program where Tap A Tradie\r\n        books, manages and schedules your work, the specific Additional Program\r\n        Terms for that program will apply.)\r\n        <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        Pros can purchase the right to contact homeowners who have requested\r\n        that a Pro contact them for a particular project (a “project request”).\r\n        Information regarding a project request, and the right to respond to it,\r\n        may be made available to a Pro through email, through a telephonic\r\n        connection, through Tap A Tradie’s communications platform, or by other\r\n        means. The right to respond to project requests can be purchased through\r\n        subscription Services that have a recurring financial obligation every\r\n        month (or other time period) (“Subscription Products”) or that have a\r\n        financial obligation for each project request response or other product\r\n        that a Pro buys (“Pay As You Go Products”). Subscription Products and\r\n        Pay As You Go Products are collectively referred to as “Pro Products.”\r\n        <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        <u>Product Terms.</u> <br />\r\n        Tap A Tradie and you may agree to the term, fees and other terms of a\r\n        Pro Product (including the fees and terms applicable to individual or\r\n        categories of project requests) (\"Product Terms\") in writing,\r\n        telephonically or electronically, including by email or within Tap A\r\n        Tradie’s communication platform. If you purchase a Pro Product, Tap A\r\n        Tradie will send an email detailing the terms of the Pro Product that\r\n        you agreed to (\"Confirmation Email\"). If you disagree with the purchase\r\n        information and other terms in the Confirmation Email, you have three\r\n        days after delivery of the Confirmation Email to contact Tap A Tradie at\r\n        info@tapatradie.com with a request to cancel your purchase of the Pro\r\n        Product and receive a refund. If you do not notify us of your\r\n        disagreement and cancel your purchase within those three days, you will\r\n        be deemed to have accepted the terms set forth in the Confirmation\r\n        Email, in addition to the Terms. Note that this paragraph does not apply\r\n        to the rejection or return of individual project requests, which is\r\n        described in the next paragraph. <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        <u>Returns.</u> <br />\r\n        Once you purchase the right to respond to a particular project request\r\n        (whether you purchase it as a Pay As You Go Product or as part of a\r\n        Subscription Product), you are generally not able to reject or return\r\n        it. Please note that you are purchasing the right to contact the\r\n        homeowner with respect to their project request; you are not purchasing\r\n        any right or guarantee to perform the work. (It is the homeowner who\r\n        decides whether to work with a particular Pro or not.) We allow returns\r\n        only in limited cases where the project request is invalid (for example,\r\n        if the project request includes a disconnected telephone number or has\r\n        an obviously fraudulent name, or if the homeowner did not actually\r\n        request to be contacted) or is a duplicate of another project request\r\n        you recently purchased from Tap A Tradie. If your return request meets\r\n        Tap A Tradie’s return criteria, then the purchase price for the\r\n        applicable project request will be credited to your account. No refunds\r\n        will be given. <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        <u>Suspension; Termination.</u> <br />\r\n        Tap A Tradie reserves the right to suspend or terminate any Pro’s\r\n        ability to purchase Pro Products or otherwise use the Pro Products and\r\n        any other Services, including as a result of default in payment\r\n        obligations. Our general practice is to stop sending project requests 7\r\n        days after a Pro’s account becomes delinquent, and to suspend a Pro’s\r\n        account after 14 days of delinquency. <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        <h4>\r\n          <strong>Subscription Products for Pros</strong>\r\n        </h4>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        <u>Term.</u> <br />\r\n        The \"Initial Term\" of a Subscription Product begins on the first day the\r\n        Subscription Product is made available to a Pro and continues for the\r\n        length of time specified in the Confirmation Email unless earlier\r\n        terminated in accordance with the Terms. \r\n        <strong>\r\n          After the Initial Term, if a Subscription Product has not been\r\n          terminated, it will automatically renew for successive Renewal Terms\r\n          (as defined below) until terminated by Tap A Tradie or the Pro in\r\n          accordance with the Terms.\r\n        </strong>\r\n         A \"Renewal Term\" is a length of time specified in the Confirmation\r\n        Email. For example, if the Confirmation Email specifies a monthly\r\n        billing period, then the Renewal Terms are one month each, with the\r\n        Subscription Product automatically renewing for additional one-month\r\n        billing cycles until terminated in accordance with the Terms.\r\n        Termination of the Initial Term or the then-current Renewal Term may\r\n        only be done in accordance with the termination procedure described\r\n        below. <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        <u>Payment.</u> <br />\r\n        If you purchase a Subscription Product as a Pro, you authorize Tap A\r\n        Tradie to bill your credit card in the amounts and on the schedule\r\n        specified in the Confirmation Email, on the applicable billing dates.{\" \"}\r\n        <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        You agree to notify Tap A Tradie of any changes to your credit card\r\n        information necessary to process your payment. If Tap A Tradie is unable\r\n        to process the payment, you will be responsible for making an alternate\r\n        payment arrangement and any resulting processing fees that may be\r\n        incurred, plus late fees as described below. Any prepaid amounts are not\r\n        refundable, except as specifically described in the Terms.\r\n        <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        For some Subscription Products, we will automatically deduct from your\r\n        Tap A Tradie account balance the cost of responding to particular\r\n        project requests. The cost to respond to a project request varies\r\n        depending on service type and other factors, and may be adjusted from\r\n        time to time by Tap A Tradie in its sole discretion. To purchase the\r\n        right to respond to a particular project request, you must have a\r\n        sufficient balance in your Tap A Tradie account. Depending on the type\r\n        of Subscription Product, the number of opportunities available to\r\n        respond to a particular project request may be limited.\r\n        <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        <u>Late Fees and Billing Issues.</u> <br />\r\n        You agree to pay a late fee of $20 for each late payment. You also agree\r\n        to pay reasonable expenses (including collection agency fees and\r\n        attorneys’ fees) incurred by Tap A Tradie in collecting any overdue\r\n        amounts. You agree to notify Tap A Tradie of any billing discrepancies\r\n        or issues within 20 days after they first appear, and if you do not, you\r\n        agree that you have waived the right to dispute such billing\r\n        discrepancies or issues. <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        <u>Termination.</u> <br />\r\n        To terminate a Subscription Product, you must notify Tap A Tradie at\r\n        least 15 days (or in the case of Subscription Products billed weekly or\r\n        monthly, at least 7 days) prior to the last day of the Initial Term or\r\n        the last day of the then-current Renewal Term (as the case may be) by\r\n        contacting us at info@tapatradie.com with a request to terminate such\r\n        Subscription Product. The effective date of termination will be the last\r\n        day of the Initial Term or then current Renewal Term (as applicable) and\r\n        not before such date. <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        Tap A Tradie may terminate a Subscription Product immediately by\r\n        providing written notice to you (either by email or letter). If Tap A\r\n        Tradie terminates your Subscription Product as a result of your material\r\n        breach of the Terms, you will not be entitled to a refund of any\r\n        previously paid amount. If Tap A Tradie’s termination is for\r\n        convenience, you will receive a pro rata refund of any prepaid but\r\n        unused fees applicable to the remaining portion of the Initial Term or\r\n        the then-current Renewal Term (as the case may be) for the terminated\r\n        Subscription Product.\r\n        <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        <strong>Pay As You Go for Pros</strong>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        With Pay as You Go Products, when Tap A Tradie notifies you about a\r\n        particular project request, you can choose at that time whether to buy\r\n        the right to respond to that homeowner. The cost to respond to a project\r\n        request varies depending on service type and other factors, and may be\r\n        adjusted from time to time by Tap A Tradie in its sole discretion. To\r\n        respond to a particular project request, you must have a sufficient\r\n        balance in your Tap A Tradie account; if not, you can add funds by\r\n        credit card. The number of opportunities available to respond to a\r\n        particular project request is limited, and these opportunities are\r\n        allocated to Pros on a first-come, first-served basis. Once you respond\r\n        to a project request and pay the applicable purchase price, Tap A Tradie\r\n        will provide you with contact information for, or other means of\r\n        contacting, the homeowner.\r\n        <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        <h3>\r\n          <strong>Part 4: Additional Important Legal Terms</strong>\r\n        </h3>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        <h4>Warranty Disclaimer</h4>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        <strong>\r\n          The Services are provided on an \"as is\" basis without warranties of\r\n          any kind, either express or implied.
