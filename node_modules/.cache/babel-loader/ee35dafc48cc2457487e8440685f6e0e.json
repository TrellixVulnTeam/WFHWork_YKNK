We may also share aggregated\r\n        and/or anonymized information with Tap A Tradie Family Companies and our\r\n        and their business partners.

You agree that\r\n            these parties may contact you for the purposes of providing the\r\n            products or services you have requested, marketing, addressing\r\n            complaints, billing or other account-related matters, or other\r\n            purposes reasonably related to the services you have requested. Your\r\n            consent to receive marketing communications is not required as a\r\n            condition of purchasing any goods or services.\r\n          </em>\r\n        </strong>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        <h4>Co-Branded Partners</h4>\r\n        <br />\r\n        Some of our Services may be offered in conjunction with a Tap A Tradie\r\n        Family Company or a third party. If you request, access or use our\r\n        Services through a Tap A Tradie Family Company or a third party, or you\r\n        request, access or use their services through the Properties, both Tap A\r\n        Tradie and they may receive your Personal Information. For example, if\r\n        you sign up with Tap A Tradie, request Tap A Tradie services or consent\r\n        to receive communications from Tap A Tradie through a partner-promoted\r\n        or co-branded website or within a partner’s store, Tap A Tradie and that\r\n        partner may share your Personal Information with each other.\r\n        <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        <h4>Other Partner Programs</h4>\r\n        <br />\r\n        From time to time, we may partner with Tap A Tradie Family Companies or\r\n        third parties to offer discounts, rewards or other programs or\r\n        promotions. We may disclose your Personal Information to them if you\r\n        participate in their promotion or you purchase (or request to receive\r\n        more information about) their products or services from us. For example,\r\n        if a discount on a partner product or service is offered through a\r\n        marketing communication from us or a link between their website and our\r\n        website, we may disclose to the partner Personal Information about our\r\n        Users that contact us as a result of the marketing communication, our\r\n        Users that visit their website or their users who visit our website.\r\n        <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        <h4>Companies with Whom You Have a Relationship</h4>\r\n        <br />\r\n        If you are already a customer of or otherwise have a direct relationship\r\n        with a business partner of Tap A Tradie or a Tap A Tradie Family Company\r\n        (an “Existing Relationship Company”), we may disclose certain Personal\r\n        Information to that Existing Relationship Company. If you are a match to\r\n        a customer on the Existing Relationship Company customer’s list, we may\r\n        provide the Existing Relationship Customer with some of your Personal\r\n        Information, such as the groups or segments you belong to (such as mover\r\n        or homeowner) and demographic information about you and your home (such\r\n        as estimated household income and square footage), so that the Existing\r\n        Relationship Company can provide you with more relevant advertising,\r\n        products and services. Neither we nor the service provider will give the\r\n        Existing Relationship Company your contact information, your unique\r\n        personal identifiers, or your credit card information, unless for\r\n        another purpose permitted in this Privacy Policy. However, the Existing\r\n        Relationship Company may already have some or all of that information\r\n        (because of your existing relationship with them) and they will be able\r\n        to link you with the other information about you that we provide to\r\n        them.\r\n        <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        <h4>Service Provider Information</h4>\r\n        <br />\r\n        We do not consider the business information of Service Providers to be\r\n        Personal Information. Accordingly, we may share Service Provider\r\n        business names, owner/proprietor names, business contact information and\r\n        other information with third parties for any purpose.\r\n        <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        <h4>Compliance with Laws and Policies; Protection of Rights</h4>\r\n        <br />\r\n        We may release your Personal Information when we believe that doing so\r\n        is appropriate to comply with applicable laws, regulations, subpoenas,\r\n        warrants or court orders, or other legal requirements; to cooperate with\r\n        government or law enforcement; to resolve complaints or disputes; to\r\n        avoid legal liability; to comply with, enforce or investigate potential\r\n        violations of our agreements, Terms of Use, program-specific terms,\r\n        Privacy Policy or other policies; to bill and collect amounts owed to\r\n        us; to protect our rights, reputation, safety or property or that of\r\n        Users, Service Providers or others; and to address fraud, security or\r\n        technical issues.\r\n        <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        <h4>Sale/Merger</h4>\r\n        <br />\r\n        We may decide to sell, buy, merge or reorganize our own or other\r\n        businesses, conduct a securities offering, or do a joint venture or\r\n        other strategic transaction. We could also be involved in a bankruptcy,\r\n        liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction. Any such transaction\r\n        may involve disclosing Personal Information. We would seek protections\r\n        of confidentiality and restricted use for all information disclosed. In\r\n        the event that we or all of our assets are acquired in such a\r\n        transaction, our collected information would be one of the transferred\r\n        assets.\r\n        <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        <h4>Contest/Sweepstakes</h4>\r\n        <br />\r\n        We may publicly disclose the name, city and state of winners.\r\n        <h2></h2>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        <h3>\r\n          <strong>\r\n            Opting Out of Tap A Tradie Marketing; Editing Your Personal\r\n            Information\r\n          </strong>\r\n        </h3>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        <h4>Changing Information; Closing Account</h4>\r\n        <br />\r\n        To change or delete your Personal Information, you may log in to your\r\n        account and modify or remove specified information that resides in your\r\n        account.

In addition, to opt out of promotional text (SMS)\r\n        messages from Tap A Tradie, you can text STOP to any text (SMS) message\r\n        you receive. You may receive a final text message confirming your\r\n        opt-out. Please allow up to 10 business days to process any opt-out\r\n        request. Message and data rates may apply.\r\n        <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        <h4>Email Communications</h4>\r\n        <br />\r\n        You can unsubscribe at any time from receiving promotional emails from\r\n        Tap A Tradie by clicking on the unsubscribe link included at the bottom\r\n        of our email messages.

We reserve the right to\r\n        send you service announcements (such as notifications about site\r\n        outages) or administrative messages, without offering you the\r\n        opportunity to opt out of receiving them. In addition, because we must\r\n        communicate with you about service requests that you have submitted (or\r\n        received, if you are a Service Provider), you cannot opt out of\r\n        receiving emails, text (SMS) messages or calls from us relating to those\r\n        requests.\r\n        <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        <h4>Opting Out of Communications from Third Parties</h4>\r\n        <br />\r\n        To opt out from receiving promotional communications from a third party,\r\n        or to make requests regarding your Personal Information or other\r\n        information held by a third party, you should contact the third party\r\n        directly.\r\n        <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        <h4>Security</h4>\r\n        <br />\r\n        The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We\r\n        maintain industry-standard physical, electronic, and procedural\r\n        safeguards, such as firewalls and encryption technology, to protect\r\n        against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our\r\n        control. For example, when you enter a credit card number on the\r\n        Properties, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure\r\n        socket layer (SSL) technology. However, no method of transmitting\r\n        information over the Internet or storing information is completely\r\n        secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the protection of any\r\n        information shared with us.\r\n        <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        If you create an account, you may be asked to choose a password to\r\n        protect your account and account information.

If we learn that we have collected Personal Information\r\n        of a child under 16, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to\r\n        delete such information from our files. If you are under the age of 16,\r\n        please do not submit any Personal Information through the Properties.\r\n        <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        <h4>Third-Party Websites</h4>\r\n        <br />\r\n        Our Services may contain links to other websites and services.

Our Privacy Policy does not apply to any such\r\n        websites or services, and we are not responsible for their content,\r\n        privacy or security practices and policies. To protect your information\r\n        we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of other\r\n        websites and services that you access.
